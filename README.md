CS762: Advanced Blockchain Project

IIT Bombay

Project Topic :  ASAP: A Multi Path Payment Channel Network Protocol for a Cryptocurrency network


This is course project of cs762 where we analyzed various payment channel network (PCN) protocols and developed a new protocol for the PCN of Bitcoin.

Designed and Introduced a new payment algorithm which is ASAP: Adaptive Split of a Payment.

provided the project report and also the simulation code which in form of a python notebook file.
Anyone can simply download the file and run in jupyter notebook or google colab.
Need to give value of alpha , redundancy_of_boomerang and lambda value of exponential distribution as input. 

◦ Studied various works proposed to increase the transaction throughput of Cryptocurrency network.
◦ Proposed a new payment channel protocol in Blockchain and designed 3 splitting criteria algorithms.
◦ ASAP is based on the dynamic splitting of the payment to reduce the payment failure during insufficient
balance in a payment channel.
◦ Successfully reduced the congestion level compared to Boomerang(another protocol) without affecting the
success ratio
